# Intelligent Discussion Board

Welcome to the repository for our Senior Design Capstone Project at The University of Texas at Dallas - the Intelligent Discussion Board. This project, carried out as part of the CS 4485 course, represents an effort of our team to create a versatile, AI-infused platform for effective communication between students and professors.

## Project Overview
The Intelligent Discussion Board is a next-gen platform built to enhance engagement and information sharing among users. It offers traditional forum functionality (including threads, topics, comments, replies, and roles), but with an innovative twist of AI interaction. This backend repository contains all the codebase written primarily in Python with the Flask framework.

## Key Features
* **Forum Functionality**: Create, view, and manage threads, topics, comments, replies and assign user/professor roles. Get the classic forum experience with an interactive and user-friendly interface.
* **AI-Powered Interaction**: Leveraging OpenAI's GPT API, our platform introduces automatic AI responses to questions, creating a dynamic, intelligent dialogue on any subject.
* **Quick Help Chatbot**: Our platform has a built-in chatbot also powered by GPT API, designed to provide prompt assistance. This bot utilizes syllabus PDFs as its knowledge base, offering answers relevant to course content.
* **User Authentication**: The Intelligent Discussion Board implements a secure user-login system, featuring tokens, authorization, and password hashing, ensuring the security of user information.
* **Relational Database Connection**: Our platform connects to a robust relational database consisting of 10+ interconnected tables, facilitating the organized storage and retrieval of user data and activities.
* **RESTful API Design**: The system implements a RESTful API design allowing seamless interaction between the frontend and the backend, ensuring data consistency and integrability.
* **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Our repository is configured for CI/CD with Heroku, allowing for seamless updates and deployment of the backend.
